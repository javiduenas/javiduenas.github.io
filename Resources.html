    <h3>LANGUAGE - WRITING   - EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY</h3>
	  <hr>
    <p>Below are some great learning resources that I have collected for college writing students and anyone seeking to improve their English writing, grammar, and citation skills. <br>
This page is intended to be a continual work in progress, so please bear with me as I add more "goodies" here over time.</p>

<h3>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) & WRITING</h3>
<h3>What is Sentiment Analysis?</h3>
	  <p>Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing to analyze text and determine whether the sentiment of the text is positive, negative, or neutral. This can help writers convey their messages in the right style or tone.
	  <p><strong>Sentiment Analysis Tool</strong></p>
	    <form id="sentiment-form">
        <textarea id="text-input" cols="50%" rows="5" placeholder="Enter text to analyze..."></textarea><br>
        <button type="submit">Analyze</button>
    </form>
    <p id="result"></p>

    <script>
        document.getElementById('sentiment-form').addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            const text = document.getElementById('text-input').value;
            const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/analyze', {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({ text: text }),
            });
            const data = await response.json();
            document.getElementById('result').textContent = `Sentiment: ${data[0].label}, Confidence: ${data[0].score}`;
        });
    </script>
<p>Sentiment analysis models generally report two key outputs for sentiment: polarity and subjectivity.</p> 
		  <blockquote><p><strong>Polarity</strong> measures whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. -1.0 indicates a very negative sentiment, 0 indicates a neutral sentiment, and 1.0 indicates a very positive sentiment.</p>
		  <p><strong>Subjectivity</strong> measures how opinionated or objective the text appears, providing scores ranging between zero to one. 0 indicates that the tone is very objective, and 1.0 indicates that the tone is very subjective (opinionated).</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><strong>Description:</strong> Molded by pedagogical goals, technological advancements, and cultural shifts, the evolution of the essay has resulted in an increasingly challenging landscape for academic integrity in higher education. Although the essay format was originally intended to promote objective assessment and individual development in higher education, the evolution of the essay itself and the impact of emerging technologies such as AI have paradoxically contributed to increased standardization and the evaluation of form over substance, inadvertently contributing to essay writing as a conduit for plagiarism and blurring lines of authorship between student writing and AI-generated text.</p>
	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This AI-generated "podcast" was created from an original article that I am currently working on for publication, using Google NotebookLM.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Intertextuality and Writing in Higher Education</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Description:</strong> This is a synthesis of two articles by two prominent researchers in the field of plagiarism detection in higher education, "The Ethics of Teaching Rhetorical Intertextuality" (Howard & Jamieson, 2021) and "Rethinking the Relationship between Plagiarism and Academic Integrity" (Jamieson & Howard, 2019).<br></br> These articles explore the fraught relationship between academic integrity and the use of outside sources in student writing, distinguishing between intentional plagiarism, such as academic ghostwriting or contract cheating, and unintentional textual errors like patchwriting or faulty citation. While intentional cheating can be seen as a serious violation of academic integrity, the authors suggest that unintentional errors should be treated as writing problems that need to be addressed through pedagogy rather than punishment by teaching students to engage with sources rhetorically, understand the context and value of the information, and develop their ability to synthesize information from multiple sources - not unlike this podcast. The authors advocate for a pedagogical approach that emphasizes rhetorical intertextuality, fostering a dialogic relationship between writer, sources, and audience, and helping students develop the skills to use sources effectively and ethically.</p></blockquote>

	  <blockquote><p><strong>Description:</strong> This podcast episode provides a guide on how to write effective prompts for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It outlines the five key characteristics of effective AI prompts - Task, Context, Audience, Tone, and Specificity (T-CATS) - and emphasizes that clear and specific prompts lead to more informative and relevant responses from AI systems. The document provides several examples of weak and strong prompts, highlighting how improving clarity, context, and focus can significantly enhance the quality of AI output.</p></blockquote>
